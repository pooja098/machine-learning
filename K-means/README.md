ex7.pdf is the manual for the exercise, first go through it.
ex7.m is the main script for octave.
The script first tests the algorithm on some test data and then applies it to the bird image.
After cloning this repo navigate to it on terminal, then start octave and then run ex7.
Make sure you have all the function and data files necessary in the directory where you are running octave.
If you have any thought(s), and want to discuss, ping me!
